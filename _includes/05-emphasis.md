Started website programming about **20 years ago** with _Macromedia Dreamweaver 1.0_ after using Microsoft's web program (I think Frontpage), after wantinging cleaner code and a better IDE.

While with a software development company, attended _University of South Alabama_ to learn object oriented programming and database development.

Am proficient in _Coldfusion_ for data driven sites and am learning _Vue.js_ for a better, efficient user interface, API calls, and single-page website development.
